# TwikitTimeIt

## UI Improvements
- The UI for starting a new timer should be on top, in this UI you always need to scroll down to start a new timer.
- (Optional) move start/stop functionality in itâ€™s own container above the list.
- Provide inputfield to give the timer a label, useful if you need to put in those times somewhere else.
- Add creation time into the UI.
- Times could be formatted into hours, minutes and seconds for readability and comprehension.
